## File Description
### Datasets
In this project, we first tried dataset from provided by our client: assessors database. We downloaded the databases for 2018 and 2019 (Dataset is free for download at this website: https://data.boston.gov/dataset). Due to some limitations in the first dataset, we then used dataset from Reference USA for our data visualization and prediction.

* Parcels_2018.csv (assessors database in 2018)
* fy19fullpropassess.csv (assessors database in 2019)
* Combined Closed Business.csv (only includes closed businesses from Reference USA)
* new all business.csv (all businesses from Reference USA)
